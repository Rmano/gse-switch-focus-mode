                        <description>Normally we show a notification each time
                        the user changes focus mode. It is a bit slow,
                        so maybe you prefer not to enable it.

                <description>When follow-mouse focus is set to "mouse",
                the focus is strictly on the windows under the mouse.
                In "sloppy" mode, the focus is on the last window
                that was under the mouse (default, recommended).
